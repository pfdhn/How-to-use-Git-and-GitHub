# Conda Basic Commands

#### There's an existing [Conda Cheat Sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) provided by Anaconda but I am listing here the common commands I typically use.


## Verify Conda installation
```
conda info
```

## Update Conda
```
conda update conda
```

## Install a Conda Package
If the command below wont work, try to check if there is a conda-forge version of the package [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge)
```
conda install PACKAGENAME
```

## Update a Conda Package
```
conda update PACKAGENAME
```
